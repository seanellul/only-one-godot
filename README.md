# Only One - Godot Game Development Journey

**A Comprehensive 24-Hour Game Development Experiment in Godot 4**

> *"A journey of rapid prototyping, system building, debugging challenges, and valuable lessons learned in game development architecture."*

---

## 🎮 **Project Overview**

**Only One** is a top-down action RPG with a unique **permadeath mechanic** - players have only one life per playthrough. The game features a static town hub connected to procedurally generated dungeons, with a progression system based on equipment upgrades and gold economy.

### **Core Game Concept**
- **Hub-Based Progression**: Static town with shops, NPCs, and portal access
- **Portal System**: 4 main dungeons + 1 final boss portal (unlocked after completing all 4)
- **Permadeath**: Death deletes save file - complete restart required
- **Equipment-Based Progression**: No XP/levels - pure gold → equipment → power scaling
- **Directional Combat**: Mouse-facing player with directional attacks

## 📈 **Development History**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Hours 1-6)**
**Initial Request**: Improve town generation system
- ✅ Centered fountain with collision
- ✅ Connected pathways to shop entrances
- ✅ Varied shop shapes (L-shaped forge, round apothecary, rectangular armory)
- ✅ Proper sign placement at shop fronts

**Challenge**: Town layout felt mechanical and uniform
**Solution**: Implemented organic road generation with varied building shapes

### **Phase 2: Game Flow (Hours 7-12)**
**Request**: Main menu and save system implementation
- ✅ Main menu with New Game/Continue/Settings
- ✅ JSON-based save/load system
- ✅ Permadeath mechanics (save deletion on death)
- ✅ ESC key save-and-exit functionality

**Challenge**: Ensuring all game state was properly serialized
**Solution**: Comprehensive save data collection from all game systems

### **Phase 3: Narrative System (Hours 13-16)**
**Request**: Cutscene system for storytelling
- ✅ Parallax background system with 3 independent layers
- ✅ Text overlay with fade transitions
- ✅ 6-scene introduction narrative
- ✅ Custom artwork integration support

**Challenge**: Array typing errors in cutscene manager
**Solution**: Proper type declarations and validation

### **Phase 4: Polish Features (Hours 17-20)**
**Request**: 5 Quality of Life improvements
- ✅ Auto-save checkpoints at key moments
- ✅ Enhanced combat feedback (screen shake, particles, floating damage)
- ✅ Item magnetism system with visual trails
- ✅ Real-time minimap with navigation
- ✅ Smart inventory sorting with usage tracking
- ✅ Contextual hints system for tutorials
- ✅ Dynamic audio system with 25 music tracks

### **Phase 5: Critical Debugging (Hours 21-24)**
**Challenge**: System complexity led to crashes and parser errors
**Issues Encountered**:
- `Property 'modulate:a' not found on object 'Label'`
- `Tween: started with no Tweeners`
- `Cannot call method 'add_child' on a previously freed instance`
- `Invalid call. Nonexistent function 'tween_sequence' in base 'Tween'`
- OS method compatibility issues (`get_static_memory_usage_by_type()`)
- Autoload dependency failures
- Critical crash: `EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGABRT)` from tween operations on freed objects

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ Comprehensive `DebugManager` autoload system
- ✅ Safe tween wrapper functions with `is_instance_valid()` checks
- ✅ Autoload validation and safe access patterns
- ✅ Memory management improvements
- ✅ Godot 4 API compatibility fixes
- ✅ `CrashTestScene` for isolated system testing

## 🚨 **Technical Challenges & Solutions**

### **Challenge 1: Over-Engineering**
**Problem**: Created a "comprehensive debugging system" that became the biggest source of bugs
**Lesson**: Debug tools should be simple; complex debugging infrastructure often creates more problems

### **Challenge 2: Tween Safety**
**Problem**: Tweening properties on freed objects caused critical crashes
**Solution**: Implemented safe tween wrappers with validation:
```gdscript
func safe_tween_property(tween: Tween, target: Object, property: String, value, duration: float):
    if not is_instance_valid(target):
        return false
    # Validation and safe execution
```

### **Challenge 3: Autoload Dependencies**
**Problem**: Complex interdependencies between autoload systems
**Solution**: Safe access patterns with null checks:
```gdscript
var audio_manager = get_node_or_null("/root/AudioManager")
if is_instance_valid(audio_manager) and audio_manager.has_method("play_sound"):
    audio_manager.play_sound()
```

### **Challenge 4: Godot 4 API Compatibility**
**Problem**: OS methods not available in user's Godot version
**Solution**: Feature detection with fallbacks:
```gdscript
func _get_safe_memory_info():
    if OS.has_method("get_static_memory_usage"):
        return OS.get_static_memory_usage()
    return "Not available"
```

## 🎯 **Key Lessons Learned**

### **Architecture Insights**
1. **Keep autoloads minimal** (max 4) - complex systems create dependency hell
2. **Core-first development** - get gameplay working before adding polish
3. **One system at a time** - thoroughly test before adding complexity
4. **Simple beats comprehensive** - elegant solutions over feature-heavy ones

### **Godot 4 Best Practices**
1. **Always validate objects** before calling methods or accessing properties
2. **Use `create_tween()`** instead of deprecated tween functions
3. **Check API compatibility** with `has_method()` before calling OS functions
4. **Separate settings from save data** - settings should persist through permadeath

### **Development Process**
1. **Rapid prototyping works** - built complex systems in 24 hours
2. **Feature creep is dangerous** - adding "one more system" compounds complexity
3. **Debug early, debug often** - but keep debugging tools simple
4. **Document decisions** - architecture choices matter for maintainability

## 🎮 **Current State**

### **What Works Well**
- ✅ Core gameplay loop (town → dungeon → progression)
- ✅ Save/load system with permadeath
- ✅ Inventory and equipment management
- ✅ Combat feedback and visual polish
- ✅ Audio system with dynamic music
- ✅ Cutscene system for narrative

### **What Needs Improvement**
- 🔧 System architecture is overly complex
- 🔧 Debugging infrastructure became problematic
- 🔧 Autoload dependencies create instability
- 🔧 Over-engineered safety wrappers

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

Based on this experience, we've created a comprehensive **Design Document** (`DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md`) for a clean restart that:

1. **Preserves the good ideas** (town generation, save system, combat feedback)
2. **Eliminates complexity** (maximum 4 autoloads, no debug managers)
3. **Focuses on core gameplay** (fun first, features second)
4. **Provides clear architecture** (simple, maintainable, extensible)

### **Fresh Start Goals**
- ✨ **Elegant simplicity** over comprehensive features
- ✨ **Core gameplay first** before any polish
- ✨ **One system at a time** with thorough testing
- ✨ **Maintainable architecture** that doesn't fight against itself
